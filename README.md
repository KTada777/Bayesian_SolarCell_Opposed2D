03 Oct 2025:

It is reported that codes in the notebooks no longer work due to the recent syntax change of PyMC.
Amended version starting with "251003" has been uploaded.
Some old notebooks cannot be opened because of compatibility issues between GitHub and Colab notebooks.

Notebooks containing "R1," which work around this issue, have been uploaded for viewing purposes only.
